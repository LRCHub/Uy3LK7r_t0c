Now I get the rhythm in tonight
Sweet whisper voice talk to me
Light beam shine on your high mind
I just get a better
So past and how can do
Carry on you so high night
I'll be free with you
Oh I still think someday
Glow light and slow heat
Oh I still think yesterday
Glow light and hot magic
Your kinky leg is tight and hard
Horny feel can't hide to you
Bad sound around my high mind
Get drunk wanna go to her body
Ain't nothin' I can do
In the from dusk till dawn
Please, please ride with me
Oh I still think someday
Glow light and slow heat
Oh I still think yesterday
Glow light and hot magic
