[00:25.04] Now I get the rhythm in tonight
[00:32.06] Sweet whisper voice talk to me
[00:39.09] Light beam shine on your high mind
[00:45.08] I just get a better da-da-da
[00:59.08] 
[00:51.00] So past and how can do
[00:57.09] Carry on you so high night
[01:03.06] I'll be free with you
[01:13.56] 
[01:09.04] Oh, I still think someday
[01:16.09] Glow light and slow heat
[01:22.09] Oh, I still think yesterday
[01:28.03] Glow light and hot magic
[01:40.03] 
[01:47.00] Your kinky leg is tight and hard
[01:53.06] Horny feel can't hide to you
[02:00.09] Bad sound around my high mind
[02:06.07] Get drunk, wanna go to her body
[02:21.57] 
[02:12.09] Ain't nothin' I can do
[02:18.04] In there from dusk till dawn
[02:24.00] Please, please ride with me
[02:37.50] 
[02:33.01] Oh, I still think someday
[02:40.09] Glow light and slow heat
[02:46.01] Oh, I still think yesterday
[02:52.02] Glow light and hot magic
[03:04.02] 
[03:24.00] Oh, I still think someday
[03:30.03] Glow light and slow heat
[03:36.05] Oh, I still think yesterday
[03:42.00] Glow light and hot magic
